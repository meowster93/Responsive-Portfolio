        I am a student at Case Western Resereve learning in a computer programming bootcamp. I honestly have very little practice in the field but back in the myspace days very much enjoyed making my own layouts. Now I get to make my own profile from scratch which is fun and a little frustrating but hey thats part of the learning process right?</p> 
        <p>I enjoy a challenge, probably why I enjoy playing video games in my free time and playing MTG and what not. Anyways not really sure what else to put here? I love cats and sometimes people are cool too.</p>
        <p>I am glad to have networked with a few of my classmates and TA's in the class, look forward to working with everyone and improving my skills daily.
